# Topics on Reproducible Research

Material for the seminar on Reproducible Research, Weill Cornell, 3-28-2017.

This is not a comprehensive discussion on reproducible research, but rather a collection of tools and concepts that help me making my code and practice as much reproducible as possible.

The seminar is roughly divided in two parts, how to produce high-quality reports, and how to archive datasets and code.

Some of the material was adapted from:

- Karl Broman's [Tutorial](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/) and [Slides](http://kbroman.org/pages/talks.html) on "Steps toward reproducible research"
- Ian Lyttle, Karl Broman, Yihui Xie knitr / rmarkdown [tutorial](https://github.com/ijlyttle/user2016_knitr) at UseR 2016
