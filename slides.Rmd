# Part I: High-quality reports

## What makes a report "high-quality"

1. Correct
2. Reproducible
3. Clear

...and?

## ...and?

- Integrates text, figures, and code
- Allows different levels of readership
- Automated
- Versioned
- Interactive
- Portable
- Beautiful

## Tools

- Reproducibility + automation: __knitr / R markdown__
- Version control: __git / Github__
- Interactive + portable: __HTML widgets__

## Literate programming {.smaller}

From Wikipedia:

Literate programming is a __programming paradigm__ introduced by __Donald Knuth__ in which a program is given as an _explanation of the program logic in a natural language_, such as English, _interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code_, from which a compilable source code can be generated.

Was Donald Knuth the original data scientist?

## knitr / R markdown

`knitr` and `R markdown` are R packages that can be used to combine text, code, and output (including figures) into a single document.

**Sweave**: R + latex

**knitr/rmarkdown**: R + (latex | markdown)

**IPython / Jupyter notebook**: python

## What is markdown?

Markdown is a markup language that is much easier to write and read than HTML or latex.

It is inspired by how people (used to) write emails, e.g.,

```
- One
- _Two_
- __Three__
```

Becomes

- One
- _Two_
- __Three__

[Cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)


## Advantages of R Markdown over Sweave

- Output html, pdf, docx
- Switch between output formats with (almost) no effort
- Presentations, websites, books!

As an example, [this presentation](https://github.com/drisso/reproducible_research/blob/master/slides.Rmd) was written in R markdown.

## How to write Rmarkdown

```{}
This is some text. _You_ can use **markdown** syntax and latex-stle math: 
$y = \alpha + \beta x$.

When you want to add a code chunk:

 ```{r}`r ''`
 alpha <- 1
 beta <- 2
 x <- rnorm(10)
 y <- alpha + beta * x
 ```
```

## How it will look

This is some text. _You_ can use **markdown** syntax and latex-stle math: 
$y = \alpha + \beta x$.

When you want to add a code chunk:

```{r}
alpha <- 1
beta <- 2
x <- rnorm(10)
y <- alpha + beta * x
```

## How to write Rmarkdown

```{}
Output and plots will appear in the document.

 ```{r}`r ''`
 summary(y)
 ```

 ```{r}`r ''`
 plot(y~x)
 ```
```

## How it will look

Output and plots will appear in the document.

```{r}
summary(y)
```

## How it will look

```{r}
plot(y~x)
```

## Chunk options

There are many options that you can set for each individual chunk or globally
for the whole document.

For instance:

```{}

 ```{r}`r ''`
 summary(y)
 ```

 ```{r, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
 summary(y)
 ```
```

## Chunk options

The following chunk is with the default `echo=TRUE`.

```{r}
summary(y)
```

The following is the same chunk with `echo=FALSE`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(y)
```

For a complete list of chunk options, see the [knitr manual](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/).

## Setting global options

You can set options globally by using the following command

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set()
```

## Make it prettier (YAML)

YAML is a human-readable language that can be used (among many things) to personalize the looks of your R markdown report. An example of YAML specifications is the following.

```{yml}
---
title: "Topics on Reproducible Research (with R)"
author: "Davide Risso"
date: "3/28/2017"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: yes
    toc_float: yes
    code_folding: hide
---

```

## R Studio

R Studio is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.

It has the big advantage of making it much simpler to work with R markdown and with Git/Github.

Live demo: 

1. Create an R markdown report in RStudio.
2. Add YAML specifications.

## So far...

We have a report that is **reproducible**, **portable**, and **automated**.

If we change the data or we optimize the code, we can easily regenerate the report.

**How do we keep track of the changes?**


## Version control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

[Link to know more](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

The main idea is that we want to **save changes** to our files at different time points
and be able to **"travel back in time"** to any previous saved versions. 

Available software: subversion, svn, git.

## Git

Git is a modern version control software that has become very popular.

The main commands (with gross oversimplifications) are:

- `git add`: to add a file to the git tree
- `git commit`: to commit the changes to the recorded history
- `git push`: to push the commit(s) to the remote repository
- `git pull`: to pull the changes from the remote repository

Many more commands exist and there are many resources online to learn git.

[A good place to start](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)

## Git

Git is extremely useful for collaborative projects, because it protects you from modifying the same file at the same time as your collaborator.

I use it all the time, even for my own projects because it gives me an easy way
to **back-up** my code and to **revert** to previous versions in case modifying something breaks everything!

## Github

One reason why Git has become so popular is the availability of free repositories like:

- [Github](https://github.com)
- [Gitlab](https://gitlab.org)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)

In addition to free space to back up your projects, they offer tools for collaborative programming (issues, pull requests, ...)

Especially Github has become very popular in the statistical and bioinformatics communities.

Bonus: free private repository with educational account!

## R Studio + Github

Again, for those who are not too confortable with the command line, R Studio can be used to interact with git/Github.

Live demo: 

1. Create a repository on Github.
2. Create a project in RStudio linked to the repository.
3. Create a R Markdown report.
4. Commit and push the changes to Github.

## HTML widgets

HTML widgets are a great way to add interactivity to your reports.

There are many R packages available [online](www.htmlwidgets.org).

Here are a couple of examples.

## d3heatmap

```{r heatmap, echo=TRUE}
library(d3heatmap)
d3heatmap(mtcars, scale="column", colors="Blues")
```

## plotly

`plotly` can add interactivity to `ggplot2` graphics.

```{r plotly}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
            geom_bar(position = "dodge") + theme_classic() +
            scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

## plotly

```{r plotly_plot}
ggplotly(p)
```

## plotly

```{r plotly2}
library(magrittr)
set.seed(24242)

diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 500),] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut, size = carat)) +
  geom_point() + theme_classic() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") -> p
```

## plotly

```{r plotly2_plot}
ggplotly(p)
```

## Live demo

1. Add an interactive plot to the report.
2. Commit and push the changes to the repository.

# Part II: Archiving data and code

## From code to scripts

Most of this is adapted from Karl Broman [Tutorial](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/).

All aspects of data analysis should be in a script!

It is all to common to "try" some code interactively, save the results, and forget what has been done to get to those results.

## From scripts to functions

Scripts often contain long stretches of repeated code (copy-and-paste).

It's better to break up the code into functions: modular and reusable.

## From functions to packages

Once you have a collection of functions, it is not too hard to package them
in a R package.

Advantages of R packages:

- No need to retrieve the script where you have all your utility functions.
- Just install it once, and then simply load it in all your scripts.
- It forces you to write documentation for your functions.

## R package resources

The (free!) book by Hadley Wickham [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz)
makes it extremely easy to get started with writing your package.

The [r-project website](http://www.r-project.org) has very extensive [manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html).

## R package structure

An R package is a collection of files, organized in a structured directory.

A typical R package, contains the following files and directories.

* R/
* data/
* man/
* tests/
* vignettes/
* DESCRIPTION
* NAMESPACE

Some of these can be missing.

## Live demo

Again, R Studio is your friend!

1. Given two numeric vectors, plot a mean-difference plot.
2. Create a function that automates this process.
3. Create an R package to store the function.
4. (Bonus) Create a Github repository for the package.

Pro tips:

- Use [roxygen](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) to automatically generate documentation files.
- Test your code with the [testthat package](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf)
- [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://travis-ci.org) to run the tests after every commit and immediately realize when they are broken.

## R packages as data repositories

R packages are not only for code, but can be used also to archive and share data.

Examples: 

- [Bioconductor experiment data](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___ExperimentData)
- [Yeast RNA-seq data](https://github.com/drisso/yeastRNASeqRisso2011)

# Final remarks

## Reproducible research and open science

These best practices for reproducible research make it easier to engage in open science.

Open science helps reproducible research: more people looking at your code, more likely to find bugs.

Whenever possible, share code + data.

## R Session Info {.smaller}

Always finish your reports with info on the R version and package versions that you used.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
